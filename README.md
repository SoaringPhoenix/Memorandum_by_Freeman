A primary Android graduation project Jason Freeman aka me did for his high-school classmate Jianxin Sun. 

This job gets me so frustrated that I almost give up Android developing once or twice.At first I think it won't be too hard to write a simple app like this. But the fact is tiny as an application as this one itself, it still frustrate me a lot.I have spent several days on it but I've only finished some fundamentals.Even now, I'm still in the process of the development of this job.Crap, this freaks me out. I promise I will get through this. After all I've made a promise to me old-time classmate. For everybody's sake, I just have to finish my job.
