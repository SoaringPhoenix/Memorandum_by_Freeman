# Memorandum_by_Freeman
A primary Android graduation project Jason Freeman aka me did for his high-school classmate Sun. 

This is an Android memorandum application. It is developed by Java in AndroidStudio.Used Sqlite3 as database.No server end, no network connnection.Just a client project.Speaking of functions, it can store memorandums, add pictures to them, update them, add notice reminders to them.Simple management of users are also provided in this project.This one is only a start up project.Serves for the purpose of learning, and my former-classmates graduation project as well...I guess.

I'm a beginner-level programmer.If you have any thoughts, welcome to communicate.My email is jason_0313@outlook.com

安卓备忘录，使用java开发，ide使用AS，数据库Sqlite3，没有网络交互，没有服务器端。功能方面包含备忘录的管理，用户的管理等。备忘录可以插入图片，设置提醒。还有很多不到位的地方。仅作为练笔app存在。
